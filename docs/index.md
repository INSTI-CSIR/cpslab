# CSIR CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS LAB (CPSLab)

This Lab is spawned from the CSIR-INSTI Makerspace in an initial partnership with the Mikrobot Academy and the Ghana Robotics Academy Foundation. The CPSLab is open for partnerships beyond this initial collaboration with the aimed of becoming a co-innovative space where like-minded persons gather to work on projects, share tools and expertise as well as learn from each other.

The Lab is established as a solution hub based on applied research into accelerating technologies in electronics and telecommunications for providing actionable recommendations targeted at creating new businesses from innovations.
